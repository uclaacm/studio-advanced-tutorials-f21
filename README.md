# Studio Special Topics Tutorials - Fall 2022
## Welcome to the Special Topics Track!
In this weekly workshop series, you will be exposed to different type of games and systems in game development, from planetary gravity, to artificial intelligence! Our tutorials are made with beginners in mind, so don't worry if you haven't done anything in Unity before! Live workshops will take place at **Ackerman 2408** from **6:30 - 8pm on Tuesdays** ~~**Boelter 4685** from **7 pm to 9 pm**~~. Unlike the Intro Track, most of these workshops are independent and do not build upon the previous workshop. But we still encourage you to attend as many as you can to maximize your learning!

We also offer the [Intro Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-intro-tutorials) and [Creative Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-creative-tutorials-f21). The Intro Track covers the fundamentals of game development and using the Unity game engine, and is a good starting point for people without prior programming experience. The Creative Track focuses on non-coding aspects of game development, such as animation, writing, and sound design, and is open to newcomers learning Unity through the Intro Track as well as creatives with prior Unity experience.
